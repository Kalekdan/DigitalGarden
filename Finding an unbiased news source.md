A good source of news is as relevant today as it has ever been. I had an interesting discussion with my Dad over Christmas about where we get our news. Living in the UK, we're fortunate that the primary source of news for most people (the BBC), is largely unbiased. Or is it?

I'm aware its somewhat left leaning, but I generally trust it, while mocking at the state of news overseas. From over here, the US seems to have wildly biased news reporting, but at least the biases are obvious (or should be). It dawned on me that I don't actually know how unbiased the BBC is, especially with the drama around its [panorama edit.](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c0mx28vlp4wo)

I thought it would be interesting to see where the BBC sits on several key political views, and find the best news source for me (a somewhat liberal young man living in the UK). Is unbiased actually the goal? Or is it as good to have a bias as long as your consumers know and can recognise it?

## Can we trust the BBC?

Its clear (or as clear as an opinion poll in a discussion about bias can be) that the public (in 2023) considered the BBC one of the more trustworthy sources of news - [(YouGov)](https://yougov.co.uk/politics/articles/45744-which-media-outlets-do-britons-trust-2023). Having said that, opinion polls are by their very nature biased. If a far right media outlet was the only place you got your news, I'm sure you'd believe it to be honest and true, but only by taking a step back can we find the truth of it.

For those who don't know, the BBC is a publicly funded broadcaster, and where [43% of Brits get their news](https://www.ofcom.org.uk/siteassets/resources/documents/research-and-data/tv-radio-and-on-demand-research/tv-research/news/news-consumption-2024/news-consumption-in-the-uk-2024-report.pdf?v=379621). It's impact is undeniably massive, and it claims to be an impartial news outlet. Due to the nature of it's public funding, it theoretically shouldn't cater to stories for the sake of drawing in audiences, or stirring drama. The BBC has had their fair share of drama over the past few years though, with various scandals of misconduct within the organisation being ignored or actively brushed under the carpet. That being said, BBC news does itself report on these scandals of the wider organisation.

Perhaps the biggest (or at least most recent) of these scandals is the (in)famous Panorama edit where in one of their invesgative programs (Panorama), edited some of Trumps speech on January 6th is edited 'unfavourably', and appears to show him pretty bluntly encouraging violence. Now I won't pretend to be a fan of Trump, but this is a pretty awful and misleading and really makes me doubt what was my main source of news. As someone who is fairly left leaning, I also find it incredibly frustrating and undermines a lot of the criticisms levied against Trump, but that's a whole other discussion.

## What does it mean to be unbiased?
So what do I actually want from a news source? Should a news source cater to the public and align with their innate biases? If the country is 75% left leaning, should the news also be approximately 75% left? In my opinion this is not unbiased. We should endeavour to find news outside of our political standing, and recognise our blindspots.
