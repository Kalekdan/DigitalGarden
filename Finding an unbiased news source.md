A good source of news is as relevant today as it has ever been. I had an interesting discussion with my Dad over Christmas about where we get our news. Living in the UK, we're fortunate that the primary source of news for most people (the BBC), is largely unbiased. Or is it?

I'm aware its somewhat left leaning, but I generally trust it, while mocking at the state of news overseas. From over here, the US seems to have wildly biased news reporting, but at least the biases are obvious (or should be). It dawned on me that I don't actually know how unbiased the BBC is, especially with the drama around its [panorama edit.](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c0mx28vlp4wo)

I thought it would be interesting to see where the BBC sits on several key political views, and find the best news source for me (a somewhat liberal young man living in the UK). Is unbiased actually the goal? Or is it as good to have a bias as long as your consumers know and can recognise it?

## Can we trust the BBC?

Its clear (or as clear as an opinion poll in a discussion about bias can be) that the public (in 2023) considered the BBC one of the more trustworthy sources of news - [(YouGov)](https://yougov.co.uk/politics/articles/45744-which-media-outlets-do-britons-trust-2023). Having said that, opinion polls are by their very nature biased. If a far right media outlet was the only place you got your news, I'm sure you'd believe it to be honest and true, but only by taking a step back can we find the truth of it.

## What does it mean to be unbiased?
Bias relative to population is not the same as unbiased imo.
