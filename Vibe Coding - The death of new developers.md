I vibe code from time to time, but I always check what the AI is generating, and review each action carefully. If you're not careful it can get sloppy very quickly.

I feel fortunate that I'm able to write some code myself, but I find it more and more intimidating knowing what might have taken me a day or more to work out and solve, I can get a copilot to build in a matter of minutes. Why would I not take the help when I can get it?
