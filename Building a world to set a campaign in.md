I started worldbuilding as a hobby in and of itself nearly 10 years ago now, with no goal in mind other than to realise a fictional, fantastical land. Several years later, when I got into Dungeons & Dragons in the COVID lockdown, I ended up reusing much of the world I'd built as a setting for my first long and fully homebrew campaign - 'The Isles of Fate'

I spend countless hours designing the world with no intention of setting any kind of TTRPG there (I don't think I even knew what a TTRPG was when I started), so there are certain shortcomings which I have tried to overcome in future campaigns I've run. Having said that...
## Why you should do what I did
### Worldbuilding is fun
First and foremost, if you enjoy building a world, as I did, then that is enough reason in itself to run with it, and spend as much time as you like building a stage for your imagination. Just know up front that that is all it is - for you.

If you are happy to sink hours into content which a) your players may never see, and b) your players might not care about, then don't let me, or anyone stop you. And I don't intend to be mean when I say that, as it's the purest form of creativity when it is only for yourself, I just want to make sure you understand what you're signing up for.

Disclaimer out of the way - worldbuilding is fun, and if you can share that with other people even better. That is the first, and probably most important reason to build your world from scratch.
### A true sandbox experience
The reason I was so keen to use my world for this campaign was because I knew how expansive it was, and how that could make a real sandbox experience for my players. I'd already designed 6 continents with a number of cities, warring factions, religions and a whole timeline of history behind it all. Not to mention drafting out the moon and the starts - yeah I might have gone a bit too deep.

But a sandbox TTRPG had always appealed to me - the ability to go anywhere, do anything and speak to anyone sounds amazing. And if I already had the world, the players should just slot right in.
## Why you shouldn't do what I did
### A sandbox can be vague free 

### Building a world for a game, and for worldbuilding sake are very different skills
