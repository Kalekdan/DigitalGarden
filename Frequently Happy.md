I've been a fan of David Larbi for a while after hearing some of his charming poetry on TikTok a year or so ago, so when I saw he was releasing a book **'Frequently Happy',** I didn't take much convincing to pick it up.

It's a beautiful book full of **poetry** and **observations**, and interestingly, a few areas for prompted journaling. As mentioned when [[The First Tree in a Forest|starting this garden]], journaling is something I've tried before, but never managed to stick with. I'm never quite sure what to write, but I know that I want to.
