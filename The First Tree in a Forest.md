So here we are, the first entry, or seed, planted in my digital garden. Assuming this doesn't get forgotten like so many other project, hopefully the first of many.

Digital gardens are a relatively new concept to me, so I'm sure my style and even the site itself will evolve a lot over time, but for now this is it. I expect this note will grow as well - after all, it is only a seed.... (and I'm aware of how much I'm overusing the plant/seed metaphor - trust me, I will keep going until there are no more plant related puns left).

### Starting a new year
A digital garden feels like a very apt place to start 2026. Some of my goals for 2026 are the classic *'go to the gym'*, *'read more'* or *'stop ordering takeaway every other day'*, but I felt the need to set myself a more personal goal to journal, and note take, and just generally get the contents of my brain out onto paper (or a keyboard). That's where this garden fits in. I've developed this web site (very quickly and probably poorly) in the last few days of 2025. Its that 'bit-in-between-christmas-and-new-year' (or '*BIBCANY*' as my friend delightfully calls it) where we end a year as we mean to continue the next. 

I know how my mind works better than anyone, and I'm fully aware of my tendency to put things off, or keep it 'WIP' or 'TBC' or 'TODO' forever. So a digital garden should help me challenge that. It's all public by design, from the earliest formed ideas, to fully fledged articles, research and ramblings. (hence also why it is pretty basic at the moment - I wanted to get an MVP {there's another acronym for you} out as soon as I could).
### Keeping it going
I hope I keep this garden as alive as I picture, but who is to know. I've tried journaling several times in the past, but never made it beyond a week or so. I'm making a promise to myself now that I won't restrict what ends up in this garden. It might be of interest to you or it might not, but it's what I want to write so I will write it. Hopefully this freedom gives the plants room to grow as they deserve.

That's it for the plant puns for now I promise. See you in the next one.
